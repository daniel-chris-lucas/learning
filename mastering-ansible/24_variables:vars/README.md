# Variables: vars

While automation exists to make it easier to make things repeatable, all of your systems are likely not exactly alike.

On some systems you may want to set some behavior or configuration that is slightly different from others.

Also, some of the observed behavior or state of remote systems might need to influence how you configure those systems. (Such as you might need to find out the IP address of a system and even use it as a configuration value on another system).

You might have some templates for configuration files that are mostly the same, but slightly different based on those variables.
