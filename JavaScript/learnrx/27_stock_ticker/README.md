## Stock Ticker

Let's try an easier question. Let's say we have a collection of all of the prices for NASDAQ stocks over time. Every time the price of a stock changes on the NASDAQ ticker an entry is added to this collection. Let's say that ten days ago you bought shares in Microsoft, and now you want to print all of the MSFT share prices since then. Filter the collection for MSFT trades starting from ten days ago and print each price record (including the time stamp) using the print() function
