## Retrieve id, title, and a 150x200 box art url for every video

Create a query that selects {id, title, boxart} for every video in the movieLists. This time though, the boxart property in the result will be the url of the boxart object with dimensions of 150x200px. Solve this problem with map(), concatAll(), and filter().
