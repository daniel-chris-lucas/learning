## Converting from Arrays to Deeper Trees

Let's try creating a deeper tree structure. This time we have 4 separate arrays each containing lists, videos, boxarts, and bookmarks respectively. Each object has a parent id, indicating its parent. We want to build an array of list objects, each with a name and a videos array. The videos array will contain the video's id, title, bookmark time, and smallest boxart url.
