## Retrieve each video's id, title, middle interesting moment time, and smallest box art url

This is a variation of the problem we solved earlier. This time each video has an interesting moments collection, each representing a time during which a screenshot is interesting or representative of the title as a whole. Notice that both the boxarts and interestingMoments arrays are located at the same depth in the tree. Retrieve the time of the middle interesting moment and the smallest box art url simultaneously with zip(). Return an {id, title, time, url} object for each video.
