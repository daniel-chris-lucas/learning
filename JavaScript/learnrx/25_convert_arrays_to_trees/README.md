## Converting from Arrays to Trees

When information is organized in a tree like a JSON expression, relationships point from parent to child. In relational systems like databases, relationships point from children to their parents. Both ways of organizing information are equivalent, and depending on the circumstances, we might get data organized in one way or another. It may surprise you to learn that you can use the 5 query functions you already know to easily convert between these representations. In other words, not only can you query arrays from trees, you can query trees from arrays.

We have 2 arrays each containing lists, and videos respectively. Each video has a listId field indicating its parent list. We want to build an array of list objects, each with a name and a videos array. The videos array will contain the video's id and title.
