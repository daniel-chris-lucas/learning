## Implement concatAll()

Let's add a concatAll() function to the Array type. The concatAll() function iterates over each sub-array in the array and collects the results in a new, flat array. Notice that the concatAll() function expects each item in the array to be another array.

concatAll is a very simple function, so much so that it may not be obvious yet how it can be combined with map() to query a tree.
