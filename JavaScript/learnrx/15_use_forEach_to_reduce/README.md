## Use forEach to find the largest box art

Use forEach to find the largest box art. Each time we examine a new boxart we update a variable with the currently known maximumSize. If the boxart is smaller than the maximum size, we discard it. If it's larger, we keep track of it. Finally we're left with a single boxart which must necessarily be the largest.
