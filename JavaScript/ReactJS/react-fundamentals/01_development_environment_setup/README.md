## Development Environment Setup

Install necessary packages for developing React apps and setup webpack.

We will be using babel for transforming JSX and ES2015 to JS.

```
npm install babel webpack webpack-dev-server -g
```

Install react :

```
npm install react react-dom --save
```

Install babel dependencies for project :

```
npm install webpack babel babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react --save
```

Configure webpack in webpack.config.js

Create basic hello world in App.js and import into main.js
